Idea:
- Collect data from various sensors that are located on campus
- Make data available in central cloud repository
- Provide analysis + visualisation features for data


Subsystems:
- Base station: collects data from water sensor using Lora + uploads it to cloud repo
- Cloud repo: stores sensor data
- Client: accesses cloud repo + provides visualisation/analysis
- Water probe: collects data + sends it to base station


Optional features:
- Integrate air sensor: either let air sensor upload data directly to base station, or modify base station to communicate with cloud storage


Next steps:

- Find out how data collection on probe currently works
- Design basic communication model (who initiates communication, what basic uses cases etc.)
- Get cloud server for data storage
